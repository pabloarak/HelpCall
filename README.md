# Help Call

## Introduction

Han Solo has recently been appointed General of the Rebel Alliance and seeks to strike a major blow against the Galactic Empire to rekindle the flame of resistance. The rebel intelligence service has detected a call for help from an Imperial cargo ship adrift in an asteroid field. The ship's manifest is ultra-classified, but is rumored to carry rations and weaponry for an entire legion.

This NodeJS API returns the source and content of the distress message. For this, you have three satellites that will allow you to triangulate the position but be careful! the message may not reach each satellite in full due to the asteroid field in front of the spacecraft.
